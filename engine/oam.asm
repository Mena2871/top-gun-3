; This module is responsible for managing the OAM object requests. It is meant
; to be used in conjunction with Sprites that need a number of OAM objects to
; represent its sprite. Sprites are expected to call OAMManager_Request() to
; be provided a pointer to an OAM object in RAM. When the Sprite is not needed
; it should call OAMManager_Release() to release the OAM object back to the
; OAMManager.
